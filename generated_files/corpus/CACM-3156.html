computing connected components on parallel computers  we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o log2n   an o log2n  time bound also can be achieved using only n n log2n  processors  the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean matrix   we assume that the processors have access to a common memory   simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions   cacm august  1979  hirschberg  d  chandra  a  sarwate  d   graph theory  parallel processing  algorithms  transitive closure  connected component    ca790802 db january 4  1980  12 18 pm
